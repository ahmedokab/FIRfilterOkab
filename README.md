# FIR Filter in Verilog with Python Simulation by Ahmed Okab!


This project implements an **8-tap finite impulse response (FIR) filter** in Verilog, validating it using a Python testbench pipeline. The design demonstrates how to produce a working digital signal processing (DSP) system, helping me learn alot on how to manage Verilog code, python libraries, and also making testbenches in verilog!

## ðŸ§© Project Structure

- **`fir_filter.v`** â€“ 8-tap moving average FIR filter (parameterized, signed arithmetic).  
- **`testbench1.v`** â€“ Testbench that loads input samples from a file, drives the DUT, and writes filtered results.  
- **`startcode.py`** â€“ Python script that generates a noisy sinusoidal (sine-type curve) test signal, quantizes it, writes `input.data`, reads back `saved.data`, converts fixed-point numbers, + plots the results.

## ðŸ“Š Results

The final output plot shows:

- **Blue:** Noisy test waveform (Python float).  
- **Orange:** Cleaned, smoothed FIR output ( due to Verilog).  

As you can see FIR filter works as designed. BUT there is a delay due to it being an 8 tab filter, output value depending on previous values lol. However, the data is smooth as intended.

##  Skills Demonstrated

This project has helped me gain many skills such as:

- Digital signal processing (FIR filter design).  
- Verilog RTL coding and testbenching.  
- Fixed-point representation and scaling.   
- Python-based verification with NumPy and Matplotlib.
